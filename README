Description
===========

Vim syntax file to highlight various bvh files.

This syntax file describes how to highlight:
* Strings ( Double quotes and single quotes )
* Numbers - decimal and hex

This syntax is based on messages.vim - syntax file for highlighting Linux kernel
messages, but it's not bound to positioning of elements (messages.vim requires
your logs to start with Date and time values or it will not highlight anything).

Install
=======

Copy or symlink this file to your $VIMRUNTIME/syntax directory or to
~/.vim/syntax directory
